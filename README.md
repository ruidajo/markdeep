**Attention**: This is a fork of [Markdeep's repository](https://github.com/morgan3d/markdeep) for such excellent format,
with just public issues openned.
Markdeep has been used in [several use cases](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/#examples): 
API documentation,
Syllabus,
Game design document,
Homework assignment,
Lecture slides,
Software library website,
Game report,
Blogs,
Curriculum Vitae (Resume),
Thesis,
Guitar chord diagrams.
We, at [mutabiT](https://mutabit.com/), are trying to promote Markdeep in a new use case: reproducible data narratives
like the ones exemplified in [PetitParser: Building Modular Parsers](https://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/mutabit/doc/tip/wiki/en/petitparser-building-modular-parsers--ac8zq.md.html)
and the [GIG portable wiki](https://mutabit.com/repos.fossil/gig/doc/trunk/wiki/en/gig-portable-wiki--1apbv.md.html).
While doing this, we have explored the Markdeep's possibilities and limitations and,
by openning issues and discussions, we would like to increase the public awareness of both.

While you're invited to use this repository in such public conversatiosn,
if you want to propose issues or discussions, please contact Morgan (Markdeep's author) by his preferred method (email).
